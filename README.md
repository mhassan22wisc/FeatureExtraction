This Repository is created as a portfolio of my works on Image Processing using Computer Vision.
I have Segmented the Image and measured the Depth of the keyhole and the Slope of the Frontwall which shows up as an example.

File Description:
High-speed X-ray study of process dynamics caused by surface features - Faue et al.pdf >> PUBLICATION: Is one of the published paper in using image processing
Keyhole_video_062_U18_G11_P200_V200_S3_Type_3.mp4 >> VIDEO FILE: Shows the extracted feature (Keyhole) from the Raw Video
Max_Abs_Val_N_Min_Mod_062_U18_G11_P200_V200_S3_Type_3.png >> IMAGE FILE: Image created from adjusting and overlapping all the frames to create a history of the Feature
